      perspective. This rings true in photography as well. If you are having

    <p>
      This might not seem like a unique idea, but it is often overlooked. Before
      you even point your camera at an object, visualize it. Get a clear image
      in your minds eye of how you would like to see the final product appear.
      What are the assets of the object? What is the highlight of the shot? What
      makes the image stand out? How can you capture those assets in your photo
      shoot?

      <h1>visualizing</h1>
      <li>
        By visualizing the finished product before even taking the shot, it will
        enable the right tools to be chosen. If the right image is taken, a lot
        of post editing work online can be reduced. Many photographers lean on
        online editing tools too much, so they don’t put much focus into
        capturing the right image first. Prior of hitting the shutter, visualize
        the perfect shot in your head. It involves forming an idea and seeing
        something in your thoughts. As a photographer, it's crucial to create
        and picture the shot I want to take, especially before the event.

        Photography is an important part of our lives. Photography can only be
        important though if we are in the moment and not just shooting the look
        of something. If we are just shooting the way some

      <li>
        No matter where you go photography plays into your life somehow. We
        don’t realize how big of an impact photography truly has on us until we
        see the details of our life hidden in a photograph. When you flip
        through your photo album and start looking for those details you
        suddenly realize you are truly blessed. A photograph keeps a moment
        frozen in time so we have it forever.
      </li>
      <li>
        I can always find something in a photograph that I missed while I took
        the picture. Sometimes it is someone in the background making a funny
        face which provides me with plenty of laughs. If the camera did not
        click right at that second no one would have seen that face which is
        worth seeing and showing to them when they are twenty. Other times it is
        the smiling faces which remind me about what that moment meant to them.
        Both of these examples tie back to the joy that we were experiencing in
        life.
